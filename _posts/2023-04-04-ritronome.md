_Ritronome_ is an experimental metronome that can change tempo.

Conventional metronomes are very useful for all kinds of practice but they cannot be used for music that slows down or speeds up.
So I wrote [Ritronome](/rit) to do exactly that and find out if having a variable metronome would actually help.

Go and try it out and let me know what you think on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/channingwalton) or [Mastodon](https://types.pl/@channingwalton).
